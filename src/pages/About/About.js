                        I love the quote from Aurthur C. Clarke, “Any sufficiently advanced technology is 
                        indistinguishable from magic.”  This has always been true for me.  Growing up I have
                        always been drawn to the latest gizmo or gadegt.  I once took apart my Nintendo 64 controller
                        just to see what was inside.  In doing so I lost the use of my Nintendo
                        but I gained the understanding of how the controller worked.

                        After working in tech for 10 years, I honestly felt like I was 
                        not being challenged enough in my work.  Don’t get me wrong I 
                        love what I do.  To me starting a small business I just wanted 
                        to see what my limitations were and if I would be able to achieve 
                        this task.  As of March 15, 2022, I can now say I am a business owner.

                        From playing on the regular Nintendo when I was a kid to now playing 
                        on a gaming PC with a GTX 1080 Ti graphics card; gaming has always been 
                        a part of my life.   Gaming has always been a stress reliever and a way 
                        to connect with friends.  If you are a gamer like me, I would love to 
                        talk to you about what games you play and the systems you play on.

                        Whenever I have free time, I always find myself writing

                        I do plan to create my own comic book.  I never thought 
                        having comic book knowledge would be advantageous.  But 
                        since Marvel, DC, and other comics becoming mainstream I 
                        now have friends and colleagues asking me what’s going on 
                        in the latest movie or TV show.  If you have questions please 
                        let me know.
